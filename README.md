- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Burak, 20 years old Computer Engineering Student.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning algorithms
- I've been dealing with Python for 6 years, as intermediate.
- I've made a lot of practice, projects including
  a text-based airport game(about 900lines of code)
  and a visual game with Pygame(about 1000lines of code),
  which I am planning to add Reinforcement Learning/Q Learning mechanics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Reinforcement Learning algorithms
  to create my own and implement that in my simple game
- I'm going to share my codes as I progress
